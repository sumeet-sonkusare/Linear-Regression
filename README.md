Simple Linear Regression
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

By using the given dataset I have used linear regression algorithm to predict the score percentage

Charts used: Scatter plot by using two variables of data with regression line
